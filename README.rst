Usage
============

.. code-block:: py

    >>> import numpy as np
    # we need numpy as a base libray

    >>> import FukuML.PLA as pla
    # import FukuML.PLA to do Perceptron Learning

    >>> your_input_data_file = '/path/to/your/data/file'
    # assign your input data file, please check the data format: https://github.com/fukuball/fuku-ml/blob/master/FukuML/dataset/pla_binary_train.dat

    >>> pla_bc = pla.BinaryClassifier()
    # new a PLA binary classifier

    >>> pla_bc.load_train_data(your_input_data_file)
    # load train data

    >>> pla_bc.set_param()
    # set parameter

    >>> pla_bc.init_W()
    # init the W

    >>> W = pla_bc.train()
    # train by Perceptron Learning Algorithm to find best W

    >>> test_data = 'Each feature of data x separated with spaces. And the ground truth y put in the end of line separated by a space'
    # assign test data, format like this '0.97681 0.10723 0.64385 ........ 0.29556 1'

    >>> prediction = pla_bc.prediction(test_data)
    # prediction by trained W

    >>> print prediction['input_data_x']
    # print test data x

    >>> print prediction['input_data_y']
    # print test data y

    >>> print prediction['prediction']
    # print the prediction, will find out prediction is the same as pla_bc.test_data_y
